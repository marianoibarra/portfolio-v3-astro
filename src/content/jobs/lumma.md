Developed and Styled interactive web apps for a STB (Set-Top Box). The main challenge has been to create an intuitive and friendly navigation, since all user interaction is done through a remote control. I have focused on adapting the functionalities and the user interface to the remote control, optimizing the controls and buttons to facilitate interaction. In addition, I have worked on the attractive design of the applications and I have closely collaborated with the development team to ensure their optimal operation on the STB.
